A react project using the d3 library to chart data on US and Russian spacewalks, made available at the [NASA Open Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/Raw-Data/Extra-vehicular-Activity-EVA-US-and-Russia/9kcy-zwvn)

This project was completed during my 5th and 6th weeks at the Recurse Center. My learning objectives included: 

* Complete a project that integrated the React and D3 javascript libraries
* Clean and wrangle public api data
* Construct a dynamic filter with interactions between dimensions
* Utilize CSS media queries to provide a mobile friendly layout
